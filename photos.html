The lighting, the angle, and even her facial expression were awesome. My friend who I photographed is a ballet dancer and she is incredible at what she does. I had her leap into the air and I took the picture. It took a little while for me to be able to get the shot at the right moment, but eventually we got this shot. I love it because it looks so effortless and beautiful.</p></div>

It is a different process from normal photography, but it is a lot of fun. To accomplish this type of photography I attached a macro lens to my camera along with my normal lens. I then, through some trial and error, figured out the best way to take the photos. I had to zoom in and get pretty much as close to the object I was photographing as possible. It is important to be in manual focus for this because auto focus doesn’t like to focus when you are this close to the object. It is better to focus the photo by zooming in and out. I took several images using water droplets on different objects and several without the water. I enjoyed trying macro photography. It was a little bit difficult, and I will need more practice, but its a lot of fun.</p></div>

It was a posed photo and I had a lot of fun taking it. I had to play with the light a lot on this picture. I had a dim lamp in the back behind my brother to show the bookshelves behind him and a lamp sitting in his lap. That is what produced the glow from the book. I used a little bit of editing on the image. I darkened the bookshelves a little bit to put the focus more on my brothers face. I chose to use this lighting to show that books are magical and mystical and can take you places you’ve never been before.</p></div>
